Robert Crosby (rcrosby)
Girum Ibssa (gibssa)

To build all the programs use either "make" or
"make all". To build only minls use "make minls"
and to build only minget use "make minget".

Girum's backstory on this assignment: I worked on 
this assignment solo to catch up to where Robert
was before I officially joined on. My code is
available on GitHub: https://github.com/the-real-girum/cpe453/tree/master/asgn5
We had matching functionality before I moved onto
join Robert (minls working almost 100%, albeit
some bugs with reading files with holes).
